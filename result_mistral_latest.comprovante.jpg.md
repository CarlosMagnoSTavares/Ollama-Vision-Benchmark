 Due to the nature of your request, I cannot directly analyze and extract data from an image file. However, I can guide you on how to convert an image of a document into a markdown text file using a combination of free tools:

1. Use an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool like Google's Tesseract or Online OCR Tools (such as SmallOCR) to convert the image into editable text.

2. Save the output in a format that can be easily manipulated, such as plain text (.txt).

3. Convert the plain text file to markdown using a tool like pandoc:
   ```
   pandoc input.txt -f plain -o output.md
   ```

Please note that this is a multi-step process and requires the installation of additional tools. For online solutions, you may find various web-based services that can perform OCR directly or convert images to text/markdown format without requiring any software installation on your computer.
