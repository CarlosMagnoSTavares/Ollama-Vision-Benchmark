As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to analyze image files directly. However, if you provide more information on what content to be extracted from the jpg file, I could help with extracting text from it using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It's also important to note that, depending on the contents of the document and how well the text is written, some information may not be accurately extracted.

You can use Python libraries like Tesseract or Pytesseract for OCR tasks. Below is an example:

```python
from PIL import Image 
import pytesseract 

# Create a text file to store the data
text_file = open("output.md","w")
 
image = Image.open(r"C:\Users\Carlos Magno - Biud\OneDrive\├ürea de Trabalho\OLLAMA-LAB\comprovante.jpg")

extracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
text_file.write(extracted_text)

# close the file
text_file.close()
```
This script will read the image, use Tesseract to extract the text from the image and write it into a markdown file.

However, be aware that not all images will provide perfect results. Sometimes they might contain tables or complex layouts which are hard for OCR tools to accurately process.
