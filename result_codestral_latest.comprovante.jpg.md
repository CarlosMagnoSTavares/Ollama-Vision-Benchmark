 I'm unable to extract text from an image directly because images do not contain human-readable text. However, if the file is a scanned document or contains clear text, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software can be used to convert it into editable text.

After running OCR on the given image ("C:\Users\Carlos Magno - Biud\OneDrive\├ürea de Trabalho\OLLAMA-LAB\comprovante.jpg"), I would have obtained the document content in a machine-readable format. Unfortunately, as this is an automated system, I'm unable to perform OCR operations directly on your file.

You can try using tools like Tesseract, Google's Cloud Vision API, or online OCR services to convert the image into text. Once you have the extracted text, it would be relatively straightforward to save that content in a markdown text file.
